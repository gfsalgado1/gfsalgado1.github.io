    <h1>
    HI! My name is Halo.
    </h1>

<img src="Halo.jpg" alt="">

  <p>  My birthday is September 7.
    I am 3 years old aka 21 (in dog years).
    I have been with my family for three years.
    They call me "The guard dog".
    </p>

<p> ^This is Chloe. She loves to play fetch with me. I enjoy sleeping right next to her every night.</p>

<p> ^This is Diego. He doesn't really play with me but I enjoy his company whenever he as the chance. Getting pet by him whenever he has a chance is better than nothing.</p>

<img src="giselle.jpg" alt="">

<p>^This is Giselle. My mother, my care taker, my best friend. I always get so excited when she gets home. I'm her little baby.  </p>


<p>--  I also live with Israel and Lidia. Israel always takes me on walks at the night times. He usually pretends to yell at me but then gets all cuddly after. Lidia gives the best belly scratches. I love to always be by her. Every morning, she refills my water bowl and pours me more food. </p>
